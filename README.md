ETHICAL PRACTICES:--
This requirement is dictated by many factors such as the transparency our UK manufacturing offers with regards to ethical trading, supply chain and carbon emissions.

F Chand & Co has always supported ethical working / trading throughout its 40 year history. We work closely to ensure that we provide all of our staff with the best facilities and working environment.

We also take care to ensure that any and all trading that we do with third parties and international suppliers are within public frameworks and international guidelines of ethical working.

‘Made In the UK’ products carry large export appeal with consumers trusting our quality and craftsmanship.
